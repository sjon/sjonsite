I've been fiddling around with many many scripts, ideas, mini-projects, and
all that I've got to show for it are a few websites with no content whatsoever.
So for now, I'm done with checking out what other people have created, trying
out new techniques like nested sets and multiple inheritance and such, and
finally started work on what I intend to be a small application that does one
thing very well: serve a small website with a few pages, some image galleries
and a contact form.
